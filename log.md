# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Friday 20th October

**Today's Progress**: Spent half an hour going through the Java Basics Track on Treehouse, I could have donemore but I have work at 7am tomorrow and I needed the rest.

**Thoughts**:  So after months of inconsistency I've decided to try the #100DaysOfCode Challenge again. I've struggled with being incosistent before and so I'm hoping this is finally the time where I actually stick to it 

### Day 2: Saturday 21st October

**Today's Progress**: Spent 40 minutes in this new coursera course "Java Programming:Solving problems with software" and I feel like I'm going to actually learn a lot, especially if I combine it with Treehouse. 

**Thoughts**:  So far not bad, I had a long day at work and despite not being my full one hour of code, I still did a little bit today and that's the goal.
